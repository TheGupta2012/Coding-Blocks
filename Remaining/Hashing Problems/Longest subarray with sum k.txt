Again same as the 0 case.
0 is a special case of the problem.
-> Hash the cumulative sums.
-> keep the first occurence of the c.sums( first[csum[i]] ) in a map. 
-> Whenever you encounter the c.sum[i] again, the answer is gonna be max(ans,abs(i-first[k - c.sum[i]])), if it present in the hash map...
-> One another case is the fact that you have the current sum as k only, consider it too.
-> That's it, you got it.
